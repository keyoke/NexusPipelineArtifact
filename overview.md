The authentication scenarios which are currently supported by the extension are :
* Username & Password
* Anonymous

If your Nexus Repository server is deployed in a private cloud which is behind a firewall and the Azure DevOps Service does not have line of sight to the server - the Artifact fields will not be dynamically populated at design time and you will have to manually provide these values.

### Linking a Nexus Maven Repository artifact
Once you have set up the service connection, you will be able to link to a Nexus Maven Repository artifact in your release definition.
